# Multiple-People-Net-YOLO

The proposed work has many applications in different fields, surveillance, entertainment, gaming, and autonomous vehicles. 
This system also has applications in crowded scene that enables the analysis of each individual moving opposite to the group movement. Visual surveillance usually requires the detailed human activity of each individual separately. Detecting activity for 
each person separately demands people to be tracked. Precise information of a person can be obtained by using previous trajectories of each subject.
